### The Vision
My goal is to combine the core engineering principles from my **B.Tech at NITRA** with the advanced analytical skills from **IIT Madras**. 

### Why Python?
Python is the bridge between these two worlds. Here is a snippet of how I'm using it to analyze academic data:

```python
import pandas as pd

def check_progress(semester, credits):
    if credits >= 20:
        return f"Semester {semester} is on track!"
    return "Keep pushing!"

print(check_progress(3, 22))
